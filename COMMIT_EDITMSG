1. Tested login + apiary creation
2. Sub-collections work if we call them individually. In the past we did 
firestore().collection(`Users/{user.emal}/Apiaries)` which made it not work.
3. Store the image URI instead of the download link. Download link would be too slow to generate

Future goals
1. Clean code
	- Get rid of random imports
	- Comment
	- Remove useless code/variables
	- pod install & npm install
2. current location button
